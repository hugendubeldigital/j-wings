/**
 * A filechooser shows a textfield with a browse-button to enter a file.
 * The file is uploaded via HTTP and made accessible to the WingS application.
 * <p/>
 * <p>The uploaded file is stored temporarily in the filesystem of the
 * server with a unique name, so that uploaded files with the same
 * filename do not clash. You can access this internal name with
 * the {@link #getFileDir()} and {@link #getFileId()} methods.
 * The user provided filename can be queried with the
 * {@link #getFileName()} method.
 * <p/>
 * Since the file is stored temporarily in the filesystem, you should
 * {@link File#delete()} it, when you are done with it.
 * However, if you don't delete the file yourself, it is eventually
 * being removed by the Java garbage collector, if you haven't renamed it
 * (see {@link #getFile()}).
 * <p/>
 * <p>The form, you add this SFileChooser to, needs to have the encoding type
 * <code>multipart/form-data</code> set
 * (form.{@link SForm#setEncodingType(String) setEncodingType("multipart/form-data")}).
 * <p/>
 * <p>You can limit the size of files to be uploaded, so it is hard to make
 * a denial-of-service (harddisk, bandwidth) attack from outside to your
 * server. You can modify the maximum content length to be posted in
 * {@link org.wings.session.Session#setMaxContentLength(int)}. This is
 * 64 kByte by default, so you might want to change this in your application.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * The SFileChooser notifies the form if something has gone
 * wrong with uploading a file.
 * <p/>
 * <b>Szenario</b>
 * Files that are too big to be uploaded are blocked
 * very early in the upload-process (if you are curious: this is done in
 * {@link org.wings.session.MultipartRequest}).
 * At that time, only a partial input is
 * read, the rest is discarded to thwart denial of service attacks. Since we
 * read only part of the input, we cannot make sure, that <em>all</em>
 * parameters are gathered from the input, thus we cannot just deliver the
 * events contained, since they might be incomplete. However, the file
 * chooser needs to be informed, that something went wrong as to present
 * an error message to the user. So in that case, only <em>one</em> event
 * is delivered to the enclosing <em>form</em>, that contains this
 * SFileChooser.
 * <p/>
 * <p>Note, that in this case, this will <em>not</em> trigger the action
 * listener that you might have added to the submit-button.
 * This means, that you <em>always</em> should add your action listener
 * to the {@link SForm} ({@link SForm#addActionListener(java.awt.event.ActionListener)}),
 * <em>not</em> the submit button.
