<h3>Introduction</h3>
WingS handles GUI components, that are rendered via a GUI description language
(HTML, Stylesheets) that is transferred to a client (browser). 
The server and the client are typically separated by a network link with
finite speed, therefore the communication between the client and the server
should be minimized.
<p>
The following techniques are commonly used to address this problem:
 <ul>
  <li><em>Server:</em> Send only changes.<br>
      The server must determine, if and what has changed since
      the last dowload of the client and send only changes. 
      <br><b>Example:</b> If an web-application
      has more than one HTML-frame, it makes sense to send only frames to the
      client whose content actually have changed.</li>
  <li><em>Client:</em> Caching.<br>
      The client gets information from the server about the timeframe of
      validity of a resource, and stores it locally for that timeframe.
      <br><b>Example:</b> An icon, that is used in several buttons
      or labels, and does not change, can be cached for the entire lifetime
      of the session.</li>
  <li>And, of course, minimize the size of the pages to be sent in the
      parts that can be influenced (like length of unique identifiers etc.)
      </li>
 </ul>
<p>
WingS tries to maximize the transfer speed by utilizing all of the techniques
above.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<h4>Changed Component Sending</h4>
  reload (code,style,script) ; invalidation of frames.

<h4>Events</h4>
 event - encoding (small page); events should only be fired, if they come
 from a current page (events from an outdated page - version,epoch);
