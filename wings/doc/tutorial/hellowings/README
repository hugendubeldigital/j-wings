WingS Tutorial v0.1
===================


Description
-----------
The WingS tutorial is a web application to show how to set up and
run a WingS application.  If installed properly, a servlet container can serve
slides which describe step by step how to set up, implement, compile and deploy
a "HelloWingS!" example.

Installation
------------
Before installation, you need a working servlet container (eg. http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat).
Also you will need a working ANT tool (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant).


Build the war-file by typing "ant war" at the command line and execute this.

The resulting "war"-file is placed in the directory "build/packages".
Copy, link or move this file to your servlet container war application directory and restart your servlet container.
