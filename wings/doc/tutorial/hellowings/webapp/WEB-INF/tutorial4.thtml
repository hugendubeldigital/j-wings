<h1>Libraries and Compiling</h1>
<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p>Before you can compile the servlet, you have to make sure, that all the necessary libraries are installed. You need four libraries:<ul><li>from the Java Servlet API: "<code>servlet.jar</code>", this library is delivered together with Tomcat, so locate it there.</li><li>from the WingS-Project: "<code>wings.jar</code>", "<code>css1.jar</code>" and optionally "<code>old.jar</code>".<br/> Since we are using the logging mechanism of JDK1.4, you need the "<code>logging.jar</code>" from the WingS-Project either.<br/>These libraries can be compiled from the WingS package or a WingS CVS checkout.<br/>See the WingS documention on how to create the libraries.</li></ul><p>Copy these libraries into "<code>TOMCAT_DIR/webapps/helloWingS/WEB-INF/lib</code>".</p>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>Now compile the classes by invocing the JAVAC. The following command will do the trick.</p></p>
<table bgcolor="#D0D0D0"><tr><td>"<code>javac TOMCAT_DIR/webapps/helloWingS/WEB-INF/classes/*.java</code>"</td></tr></table>
<p>After compiling the classes did run correct, you can go on with <object name="nextstep">next page</object>, else correct the errors and recompile. Especially check if "<code>JAVA_HOME</code>" is set correctly and all libraries are installed in the correct places. The compiler will tell you, whether you mistyped anything in the <em>HelloWingS</em> code.</p>
