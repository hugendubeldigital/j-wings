<h1>HelloWings - Tutorial for wingS</h1>
<p>This site is the initial site to access the <em>HelloWings Tutorial</em>.</p>
<p>Within this tutorial all required steps are discussed to set up a working wingS application from scratch. Even if you are not familiar with setting up a servlet container and running applications in it, this tutorial will help you to success.</p>
<p>Since most professional web servers are running under an UN*X environment, I only cover here the setting up of a Linux (which is UNIX) server. It is not very difficult to do the required steps in other environments, e.g. Windooze, because anything related to the servlet container is platform independent.</p>
<p>Now follow me to the <a href="WingSTutorial">tutorial</a> (the tutorial itself is also a wingS application).</p>
