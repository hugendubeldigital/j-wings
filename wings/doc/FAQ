Q: What is wingS?
A: wingS is net generation Swing.


Q: Why should I use wingS?


Q: What are the requirements for wingS?
A: Several things:

   - a computer :)

   - Java 2
     (We are using wingS with sun's JDK 1.2.2 and sun's JDK 1.3 beta.)

   - a web server capable handling serlvets
     (We are currently using Apache with JServ only; other implementations
     which also use newer JSDKs such as Tomcat might not work yet?)

   - sun's JSDK2.0 or the LGPL'ed implementation by Paul Siegmann and Mark
     Wielaard which is also included in Apache JServ 1.1.2.


Q: How do I install it?

Q: How do I create a new servlet using wingS?
A: This depends on the type of servlet you want to create:

   - If you only want a very simple one, you only need one class
     FooBarServlet which extends org.wings.servlet.SessionServlet and
     overwrites the method postInit to do something. See
     demo/wingset/Test.java for an example.

   - Otherwise you will need at least two classes, FooBar and FooBarSession.
      - FooBar should extend org.wings.servlet.WingServlet and overwrite the
        method generateSessionServlet which returns new instances of
        FooBarSession.

      - FooBarSession should extend org.wings.servlet.WingServlet and
        overwrite the method postInit to do something.

     See demo/wingset/WingSet.java and demo/wingset/WingSetSession.java for
     an axample.


Q: What is this org.wings.session stuff?


Q: What is a plaf?
A: wingS supports some kind of pluggable look and feel. Each SComponent
   delegates it's codegeneration to a special ComponentCG. There are different
   CGs for each SComponent and each plaf. For now, there exist two plafs
   xhtml/css1 and xhtml/old. Feel free to implement additional plafs like wap 
   or xml/xsl ;-)


Q: How can I use another plaf?


Q: How can I write a new plaf?
A: I suggest, your first copy the most applicable from the existing plafs to a
   new package and then successively implement the CGs for each component


Q: What is an Externalizer?


Q: How can I use another Externalizer?


Q: How can I write a new Externalizer?


Q: Where can I find more information about wingS?
A: Read the javax.swing API docs from Sun Microsystems ;-)
