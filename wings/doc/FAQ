Q: How do I create a new servlet using wingS?
A: This depends on the type of servlet you want to create:

   - If you only want a very simple one, you only need one class
     FooBarServlet which extends org.wings.servlet.SessionServlet and
     overwrites the method postInit to do something. See
     demo/wingset/Test.java for an example.

   - Otherwise you will need at least two classes, FooBar and FooBarSession.
      - FooBar should extend org.wings.servlet.WingServlet and overwrite the
        method generateSessionServlet which returns new instances of
        FooBarSession.

      - FooBarSession should extend org.wings.servlet.WingServlet and
        overwrite the method postInit to do something.

     See demo/wingset/WingSet.java and demo/wingset/WingSetSession.java for
     an axample.
