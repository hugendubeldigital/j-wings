<h1>wingS Architecture</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
WingS is a servlet development framework. It uses the models, events and event
listeners from Swing. Most Swing components have a wingS pendant with a similar
API and behaviour. Like in Swing, the components are arranged in a hierarchy of
containers, whose root container is hooked to a frame. WingS consists of three
layers:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Swing like component model</li>
  <li>wingS Session</li>
  <li>Servlet API</li>
</ul>

<p>
Figure 1 shows the basic architecture of wingS. The wingS application
development happens in the upper layer and is very similar to the application
development with Swing. All modern concepts, like MVC, events and listeners and
highlevel components are available. Porting of simple Swing applications to
wingS is a job of a few minutes. Ideally it does not take more than replacing
'J's with 'S's: JTree -> STree, JMenu -> SMenu, ...
</p>

<p>
There's one Session instance per HTTPSession. The Session can be conceptionally
compared to java.lang.System. The Session is the bridge between the component
model and the standard servlet API. It aggregates the Dispatcher, that delivers
low level events to the components and the Externalizer, that makes resources
available via HTTP. The Dispatcher is related to the HttpServletRequest, whereas
the Externalizer delivers resources through the HttpServletResponse.

The session state is spreaded over the components and their models. A request
might lead to state transitions of some components and thus invalidate the
containing resources.
</p>

<h2>Event Model</h2>
<p>
The parameters of a HttpServletRequest are considered low level events. A low
level event has a name, that consists of the target component's id and an epoch.
The epoch allows the dispatcher to determine, if the event originated from a
current page or from a cached page (back button) or reload request. Only current
events are delivered to their target components. Outdated events are ignored.
In the process of delivery, some components might adapt their state. After all
low level events have been delivered, each component gets the chance to fire
high level events. It's the component's job to react on the low level event. The
text field will store the parameter value as its text property and fire
TextEvents. The button will ignore the parameter value and fire ActionEvents.
</p>

<p>
The following code snippet shows how events are encoded in html:
</p>

<pre>
   &lt;input type="text" name="epoch_id" value="some text"/&gt;
</pre>
<pre>
   &lt;a href="_resource?epoch_id=_id"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The url of the anchor contains three units of information:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>resource - id of the target resource</li>
  <li>epoch - epoch of the frame</li>
  <li>id - the id of the component</li>
</ul>


<h2>Externalization</h2>
<p>
If a resource (icon, HTML page, style sheet, ...) should be accessible to the
client, it has to be "externalized". That means: the resource has to be
registered at the ExternalizeManager under a resource identifier. There is one
global ExternalizeManager per servlet and another one per session. Every
ExternalizeManager holds a map, that maps resource identifiers to resources.
The id can be coded into an URL, that is placed somewhere in the html code or
javascript code. When the browser requests that URL, the WingServlet or
SessionServlet passes the id to its ExternalizeManager. An
<code>org.wings.externalizer.Externalizer</code> handles the marshalling of the
resource. There are different externalizers for different resources. Beyound
that, resources are divided into dynamic and static resources. The following
table shows some of them:
</p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Externalizer</th>
    <th>DynamicResource</th>
    <th>StaticResource</th>
    <th>StyleSheet</th>
    <th>Text</th>
    <th>Image</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>supported classes</th>
    <td>DynamicResource<br/>
        DynamicCodeResource<br/>
        DynamicScriptResource<br/>
        DynamicStyleSheetResource</td>
    <td>StaticResource<br/>
        ClassPathResource<br/>
        FileResource<br/>
        ResourceImageIcon</td>
    <td>StyleSheet</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>ImageIcon</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Static resources keep their URL as long as they exist. Dynamic resources have an
epoch counter, that is incremented on every change (->invalidation) and thus
alter their URL. This prevents proxies and browsers from caching them. An
externalized resource has one of the following scopes / flags:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>REQUEST</dt>
  <dd>the resource is removed from the externalize manager after one
      request</dd>
  <dt>FINAL</dt>
  <dd>the expired date header is set to a big value, thus the
      resource will be cached</dd>
  <dt>SESSION</dt>
  <dd>the resource is only available to requests within the session. The object
      is not accessible anymore after the session is destroyed (it is garbage
      collected after the session is garbage collected)</dd>
  <dt>GLOBAL</dt>
  <dd>the resource is available to all requests. It is never garbage collected
      and available over the lifecycle of the servlet container</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Pluggable Look And Feel</h2>
<p>
Today's browser landscape is scattered with incomplete and buggy implementations
of loose specifications and recommendations of the W3C. The same HTML code looks
different on different browser's vendors and versions.
</p>

<p>
wingS addresses this problem with a concept similar to Swing's pluggable look
and feel. A LookAndFeel consists of a CG for every component and a properties
file, that maps CG classes to component classes. Each component delegates its
rendering task to a special CG (code generator). The LookAndFeelFactory chooses
a LookAndFeel on session initialization. The decision might be based on the
browser identification. The LookAndFeel can be replaced / reloaded on the fly.
It's not obligatory, that a LookAndFeel generates HTML code. Also WML or even
PDF are possible.
