<h1>wingS Architecture</h1>

<h2>WingServlet and SessionServlet</h2>
<p>
The <code>org.wings.servlet.WingServlet</code> is the underlying servlet, that
is derived from <code>javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet</code>. Its responsibility
is the creation of new SessionServlets, delegation to existing SessionServlets
and serving global / common resources. The
<code>org.wings.servlet.SessionServlet</code> represents a user session. It
references the top level frame and serves dynamic and static resources. A
minimal application consists of two classes. One is derived from WingServlet,
the other from SessionServlet.
</p>
<p>
The WingServlet receives all HttpRequests. A request consists of up to three
parts:
<ul>
  <li>session identifier</li>
  <li>request parameters</li>
  <li>resource identifier</li>
</ul>
.. and divides into two phases:
<ul>
  <li>processing events (if request parameters are contained)</li>
  <li>delivering a resource (identified by the pathinfo)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Request Handling</h2>
If the request contains a session identifier, it will be forwarded to the
corresponding SessionServlet. If there's no session context, it might be a
request for a global resource, that can be handled by the
<code>org.wings.externalizer.SystemExternalizeManager</code> (see below for more
info on externalizers). If both is not the case, a new SessionServlet and thus a
new user session will be created.
</p>
<p>
When an existing SessionServlet receives a request, it lets the
<code>org.wings.SRequestDispatcher</code> dispatch the request parameters -
which can be considered as low level events - to the particular components. The
components will fire high level events (as we know them from Swing), which will
most probably involve changes on the overall session state. The process of event
dispatching can be compared with the event dispatching thread of Swing. When a
new SessionServlet is created, its init method is called. The init method
normally contains code, that loads configuration and sets up the GUI.

    <td colspan="2" align="center">toplevel frame</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Event Dispatching</h2>
<p>
The wingS event dispatching mechanism is very similar to Swing's event
dispatching thread. Every component has a unique identifier. Interactive
components, like STextField, etc. use this id as part of the name attribute:
</p>
<pre>
   &lt;input type="text" name="epoch_id" value="some text"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
or as the name of a GET parameter:
</p>
<pre>
   &lt;a href="?epoch_id=_id"&gt;button&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
<p>
It is obvious, that in both cases, the id will be contained as the name of a
request parameter. The parameters are delivered to the corresponding components
by the <code>org.wings.SRequestDispatcher</code>. It's the component's job to
react on the low level event. The text field will store the parameter value
as its text property and fire TextEvents. The button will ignore the parameter
value and fire ActionEvents.
</p>
<p>
In order to make sure, that outdatet events - originating from cached html
documents (browser's back / reload button) will not be processed, each event
name contains an additional <code>epoch</code>. The epoch of a frame is altered
on every state change. Whenever a component's state changes, the containing
frame will be invalidated and thus its epoch counter will be incremented. The
dispatcher checks every event for up-to-dateness before delivering it. Outdated
events are ignored.
</p>
<h2>Externalization</h2>
<p>
If a resource should be made accessible to the client, it has to be
"externalized". That means: the resource has to be registered at the
ExternalizeManager under a resource identifier. There is one global
ExternalizeManager per servlet and another one per session. Every
ExternalizeManager holds a map, that maps resource identifiers to resources. The
id can be coded into an URL, that is placed somewhere in the html code or
javascript code. When the browser requests that URL, the WingServlet or
SessionServlet passes the id to its ExternalizeManager. An
<code>org.wings.externalizer.Externalizer</code> handles the marshalling of the
resource. There are different externalizers for different resources and
resources are divided into dynamic and static resources. The following table
shows some of them:
</p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Externalizer</th>
    <th>DynamicResource</th>
    <th>StaticResource</th>
    <th>StyleSheet</th>
    <th>Text</th>
    <th>Image</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>supported classes</th>
    <td>DynamicResource<br />
        DynamicCodeResource<br />
        DynamicScriptResource<br />
        DynamicStyleSheetResource</td>
    <td>StaticResource<br />
        ClassPathResource<br />
        FileResource<br />
        ResourceImageIcon</td>
    <td>StyleSheet</td>
    <td>String</td>
    <td>ImageIcon</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
Static resources keep their URL as long as they exist. Dynamic resources have an
epoch counter, that is incremented on every change (->invalidation) and thus
alter their URL. This prevents proxies and browsers from caching them. An
externalized resource has one of the following scopes / flags:
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>REQUEST</dt>
  <dd>the resource is removed from the externalize manager after one
      request</dd>
  <dt>FINAL</dt>
  <dd>the expired date header is set to a big value, thus the
      resource will be cached</dd>
  <dt>SESSION</dt>
  <dd>the resource is only available to requests within the session. The object
      is not accessible anymore after the session is destroyed (it is garbage
      collected after the session is garbage collected)</dd>
  <dt>GLOBAL</dt>
  <dd>the resource is available to all requests. It is never garbage collected
      and available over the lifecycle of the servlet container</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Model View Controller</h2>
<p>
Like Swing does, wingS realises the MVC paradigm. wingS uses the AWT/Swing
events / event listeners and the Swing models. Furthermore it features a
pluggable look-and-feel concept, that imitates that of Swing. In fact, a
developer, that is intimate with Swing will soon gain orientation with wingS.
