/**
 * A low-level event which indicates that a component moved, changed
 * size, or changed visibility (also, the root class for the other 
 * component-level events).

 * Component events are provided for notification purposes ONLY;
 * WingS will automatically handle component moves and resizes
 * internally so that GUI layout works properly regardless of
 * whether a program is receiving these events or not.

 * In addition to serving as the base class for other component-related
 * events (InputEvent, FocusEvent, WindowEvent, ContainerEvent),
 * this class defines the events that indicate changes in
 * a component's size, position, or visibility. 
  
 * This low-level event is generated by a component object (such as a 
 * SList) when the component is moved, resized, rendered invisible, or made
 * visible again. The event is passed to every ComponentListener or 
 * ComponentAdapter object which registered to receive such
 * events using the component's addComponentListener method.
 * (ComponentAdapter objects implement the 
 * ComponentListener interface.) Each such listener object 
 * gets this ComponentEvent when the event occurs.
