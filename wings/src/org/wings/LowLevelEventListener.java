/**
 * The LowLevelEventListener interface is implemented by all components
 * that take part at the event dispatching process.
 * WingS event dispatching is complex. This is because we have to process many
 * requests at once (asynchronous user interaction). There are three levels of
 * dispatching:
 * <ol>
 * <li>process http requests ({@link #processLowLevelEvent}): If a component is
 * registered at the session specific 
 * {@link org.wings.session.LowLevelEventDispatcher} it gets all the 
 * parameters is is registered for. This parameter consists of a name-value
 * pair. Most time the component itself has encoded this parameter, so it is
 * able to decode it and change its internal state. This should be done in
 * {@link #processLowLevelEvent}. Be careful, the change of the internal state shold
 * not trigger any events, because in case of a form request, many requests are
 * processed and many states of components are changed, so if you trigger an
 * event, the listener may access a component which has not yet processed its
 * request parameters and so it is in an inconsistent state.
 * </li>
 * <li>fire intermediate events: fire events which describes a "in progress"
 * state change, like TreeWillExpand, or ListSelectionEvent with
 * getIsAdjusting() true, ...
 * After this level are components must be in a consistant state
 * </li>
 * <li>fire final events: fire remaining events. In this level all events, which
 * are important to an application should be fired. All listeners, which are
 * notified in this level can assume that the components are in a consistent
 * (considering user interaction) state.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
