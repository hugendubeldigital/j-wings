* Write scripthandler that creates an externalizeable JavaScript file containng
  scriptlets, that are attached to SComponents. The scriptlets are registered
  for component supported events (like 'onClick' or 'onMouseOver'). The
  scriptlets support parameters that refer to other components.
  ------ concept example ---
    t1 = new STextField();
    t2 = new STextField();
    b = new SButton("copy");
    b.addScriptListener("onClick", "%1.setText(%2.getText());", 
                        new SComponent[] {t1, t2});
  --------------------------
  The text %1 internally is replaced by the actual means to access the
  textfield t in the HTML-page; the scriptlet as such is embedded in a
  automatically generated function. This function is provided in the
  externalized javaScript-code - the component with the registered listener
  generates a function call to this generated function. Advantage is, that
  this keeps the page small.

  ----- extternalized js-file ---
  function _asdfoer98l() {
      document._121_1.setText(document._121_2.getText());
  }
  ------------------------------
  
  the gnerated button would be in this case
  <input type=button name="_121_3" onClick="_asdfoer98l()">

* are sessions serializable ?

* SWindow      -> use technique from frames.
  SProgressBar -> simple implementation would have two states: 'working' and
                  'done'. This could be implemented with some table that
                   has one row/column, loaded with some animated background
                   picture (some rolling spiral for example: {/////////}).
                   This background picture is displayed immediately. The
                   column contains one icon, whose download is postponed
                   by the externalizer, until the progress-bar has 100%.
                   Drawback: one open connection until the progress-bar is
                   complete which means one occupied socket and thread..

* website: make links to WingSet example and Explorer example (without
  write-access). Visualize the links to the examples as iconized screenshots
  .. this animates people to click (like the icons in freshmeat).
  Provide download-links for the war-files so that people
  can check it out immediately 'at home' without compiling first. When they're
  interested they will come back to download the source for sure.

* Jump to current position in window. This as such is not very possible with
  HTML but a near approximation would be to create an <a name="current">
  at the component that last fired an event, and create URLs, that jump
  to '#current'. Some effort has to be done, so that we can avoid this
  part, as it increases the page size (two characters per HRef-Button
  and action-URL '#c' .. this is _way_ to much). Is it possible to go 
  to some <a name=..> with JavaScript ? If we enable it only when frames
  are active, then we only need this '#current' sub-part of the URL once
  in the loading frame - much easier (and, in fact, this is often needed for
  this kind of application; consider two frames, one of it showing a tree,
  that needs scrolling - if we unfold a subtree, then we need to scroll to
  that position).
