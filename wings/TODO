(esp. for the pre-1.0-cleanup)
* docs

* are sessions serializable ?

* SWindow      -> use technique from frames.

* website: make links to WingSet example and Explorer example (without
  write-access). Visualize the links to the examples as iconized screenshots
  .. this animates people to click (like the icons in freshmeat).
  Provide download-links for the war-files so that people
  can check it out immediately 'at home' without compiling first. When they're
  interested they will come back to download the source for sure.

* Jump to current position in window. This as such is not very possible with
  HTML but a near approximation would be to create an <a name="current">
  at the component that last fired an event, and create URLs, that jump
  to '#current'. Some effort has to be done, so that we can avoid this
  part, as it increases the page size (two characters per HRef-Button
  and action-URL '#c' .. this is _way_ to much). Is it possible to go 
  to some <a name=..> with JavaScript ? If we enable it only when frames
  are active, then we only need this '#current' sub-part of the URL once
  in the loading frame - much easier (and, in fact, this is often needed for
  this kind of application; consider two frames, one of it showing a tree,
  that needs scrolling - if we unfold a subtree, then we need to scroll to
  that position).
