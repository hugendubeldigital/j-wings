wingS demo installation with JServ and Apache under Linux

0) make sure JServ or tomcat is working

1) compile wingS
     $ ant
   compile the demo
     $ cd demo
     $ ant
   This creates the war files.
   if you have the environment variable $TOMCAT_HOME set, then
     $ ant deploy
   will unpack them in your $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps

2) run it.
   To determine the size of images, wingS needs access to an Xserver under
   Unix/Linux (However, it will work without it, but then image tags won't
   contain width="xx" and height="xx" attributes).
   There are several possibilities to achive the access to an XServer:

   - xhost:
     - add "wrapper.env=DISPLAY=localhost:0"
     - call "xhost +localhost" before starting the httpd server

   - or Xvfb:
     - add "wrapper.env=DISPLAY=localhost:1"
     - start Xvfb on display 1 (/usr/X11R6/bin/Xvfb :1 -screen 0 640x480x8 &)

That's it!
