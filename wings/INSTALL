wingS demo installation with JServ and Apache under Linux

0) make sure JServ or tomcat is working

1) compile wingS. Make sure, that you have the java servlet classes
   in your classpath or in the lib/ directory as jar file.
   You need JSDK 2.2.
   To compile the wings.jar, just type ant:
     $ ant
   compile the demo
     $ cd demo
     $ ant
   This creates the war files.
   if you have the environment variable $TOMCAT_HOME set, then
     $ ant deploy
   will unpack them in your $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps

2) run it - just start you tomcat. Please note the following:
 2.1) if you have an JDK older than 1.4, you need to add the logging
      api to your bootclasspath. So you need to modify your tomcat.sh
      to include the logging.jar on the commandline
      (you find in the lib/ directory):
         -Xbootclasspath/p:/usr/src/wingS-1.0-alpha/lib/logging.jar

  2.2)
   To determine the size of images, wingS needs access to an Xserver under
   Unix/Linux (However, it will work without it, but then image tags won't
   contain width="xx" and height="xx" attributes).
   There are several possibilities to achive the access to an XServer:

   - xhost:
     - add "wrapper.env=DISPLAY=localhost:0"
     - call "xhost +localhost" before starting the httpd server

   - or Xvfb:
     - add "wrapper.env=DISPLAY=localhost:1"
     - start Xvfb on display 1 (/usr/X11R6/bin/Xvfb :1 -screen 0 640x480x8 &)

That's it!
