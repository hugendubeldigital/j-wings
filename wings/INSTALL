wingS demo installation with JServ and Apache under Linux

0) make sure JServ is working
   - try "http://localhost/jserv/" in your browser


1) compile it (this step is only required if you download wingS via CVS)
   - customize Environment.sh
   - source Environment.sh
   - make
   - make jar


2) edit <path_to_wings>/demo/zone.properties
   - adjust "repositories"
   - the rest should be OK


3) edit jserv.properties (RedHat: /etc/httpd/conf/jserv/jserv.properties).
   Please note that wingS requires access to an Xserver under Unix/Linux.
   There are several possibilities to achieve this (you only need one!):

   - xhost:
     - add "wrapper.env=DISPLAY=localhost:0"
     - call "xhost +localhost" before starting the httpd server

   - or Xvfb:
     - add "wrapper.env=DISPLAY=localhost:1"
     - start Xvfb on display 1 (/usr/X11R6/bin/Xvfb :1 -screen 0 640x480x8 &)

   - add "wings" to "zones"
   - add "wings.properties=<path_to_wings>/demo/zone.properties"


4) edit jserv.conf (RedHat: /etc/httpd/conf/jserv/jserv.conf)
   - add "ApJServMount /wings /wings"


5) restart the httpd (don't forget the X server - see 3)


6) go to http://localhost/wings/WingSet
   - if you get an internal server error, have a look at jserv.log and
     error.log (both can normally be found under /var/log/httpd).


That's it!
